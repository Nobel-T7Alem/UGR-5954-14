CareEpilepsy ETHIOPIA is a branch of the CareEpilepsy, which was registered on the 3rd February 2015 to work in Ethiopia.
My duties there involved making contributions to the patient's care and well being, help with the cleaning and provide some
insight in research projects. You can read more about CareEpilipsy by clicking this <a href="http://care-epilepsy.org/careepilepsy-ethiopia/">link</a>

        <h3 class="volunteer-title">Ethiopian Cancer Society</h3>
        <pre class="volunteer-description">
The Ethiopian Cancer Society is an organization fighting for a great cause. I had a great time learning about the 
exciting breakthroughs being made in cancer treatment and helping the afflicted recover and lead better lives. My duties
here also involved providing insight in research and helping with general tasks.
